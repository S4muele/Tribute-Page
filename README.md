# Tribute-Page

A HTML, CSS and JavaScript project made for the "Responsive Web Design Certification" offered by freecodecamp.org.

My first website ever, recently updated with some new styling and some newly learned JavaScript to implement a nice carousel on the page.

I still need to fix the website breaking on mobile and a few issues with the carousel buttons remaining in their hover state after they have been clicked on and the pointer removed from on top of them.
